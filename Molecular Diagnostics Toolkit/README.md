# Research in Diagnostics Toolkit

## Collection name historical information
This collection was formerly known as "Molecular Diagnostics Toolkit" (MDT), when this ready-to-express series of plasmids was distributed by FreeGenes, and it was in a mix of both the pOpen_v3 (aka pBuild) cloning plasmid backbone, and pOpen_v4 (aka pInducible) expression plasmid. 

When OBL/Reclone Community took stewardship of the collections (following the FreeGenes hiatus), the majority of the MDT parts (where possible) were subcloned into the [pTI](https://drive.google.com/file/d/14SbQYKgMBwG_mk9T-Ylxkf7d4PmtY8g9/view?usp=sharing) expression plasmid backbone, and the collection was renamed to "Research in Diagnostics Collection" (RiDC); see [version 1.1 OBL early 2024 Distribution (Plate 1)](https://github.com/Reclone-org/Open-DNA-Collections/blob/main/Molecular%20Diagnostics%20Toolkit/Platemaps/MDT-v1_1.csv). 

RiDC was subsequently renamed to "Research in Diagnostics Toolkit" (RiDT), but should be exactly the same as RiDC. In some older documentation, you may see the RiDC term used, but this can be treated as RiDT. 
There is a version 1.2 plate for RiDT in circulation, which again should be as version 1.1 with the exception that the pTI expression vectors (pTI, pTIR, pTIeR) have been added to column three (in wells A3, B3, C3 respectively). A new platemap should be uploaded in due course. 

Please feel free to [raise an issue](https://github.com/Reclone-org/Open-DNA-Collections/issues) here on our GitHub repo if you see any other discrepancies and/or post in the [Reclone Forum](https://forum.reclone.org/t/pti-plasmid-backbone/797/24) if you have any questions! Thank you!

## Description

Enzymes are the heart of each and every diagnostic test. Enzymes are the means by which we can track, study and defeat old and new infectious diseases.
However, enzymes are globally distributed from centralized foundries and often require a cold chain to maintain function, restricting access.
Poor access to reagents is exacerbated in times of supply chain disruptions such as those experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The Open Bioeconomy Lab has developed the Molecular Diagnostics Toolkit to combat diagnostic enzyme access restrictions. The toolkit includes:

- IPTG inducible, T7 promoter driven ready-to-use expression cassettes to produce essential enzymes used in diagnostic among which RT, Bst-LF, RPA enzymes, RNA inhibitors.
Enzymes are His-tagged and cassettes design are based on literature and experimental evidence
- A set of constructs for the production of Sars-CoV-2 RNA positive and negative controls

### What can it be used for:

The collection wants to provide researchers worldwide with an open source toolkit to produce their own enzymes, streamlining their research in
diagnostics irrespective of supply chain disruptions.

The expression cassettes in this collection have been shown to work in literature. For distribution purposes we had to clone the newly synthesized
cassettes in a novel off-patent vector backbone. The expression from this new vector has not been validated yet.

This product is made available under the unilateral OpenMTA. 

The Molecular Diagnostics Toolkit is shipped as purified and dried down plasmid DNA stained with Cresol Red in one 96-well plate. Each well contains approximately 50 ng of DNA. Cresol Red will not impact plasmid transformation.

Some or all of these items are for use only as permitted by a research exemption.
